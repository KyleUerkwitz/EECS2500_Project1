This project contains two main packages: 'LDS_Project1', and 'ArrayStack'.
It also contains 4 text documents: The main test data, two additional test data files, and this readme.

LDS_Project1 contains the main program to run. The test file path can be changed at the top of
Project1. 'Project1' uses constructors and methods from 'FileUtilities' and 'individualData'.

ArrayStack contains the stack code developed in class, and was made available to use
as per Dr. Heuring's slide notes.

Two additional test files have been generated and included to show the complete functionality
of the program if desired.
